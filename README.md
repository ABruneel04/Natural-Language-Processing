# Natural-Language-Processing

Projects and works from Natural Language Processing (Python)

Ps0:
Creates a language model that can learn on training data and be evaluated. This program makes use of add-alpha smoothing to increase the accuracy and generalization of the language model. Sentiment classifier program tests varying classifiers on training and validation sets to compute their accuracies. We look through a Multinomial Bayesian Classifier as well as Logistic Regression models using unigrams and bigrams. These can all be compared against our base case which simply returns 1 as a classification and scores an accuracy of ~50%. (IN PROGRESS!)

Ps1:
Creates a Neural Network that trains on twitter hate speech data and is able to classify that content as either offensive, hate speech, or neither using a Linear and EmbeddingBag layer.

Ps2:
HMM with Viterbi decoding for named entity recognition. Implements a neural network for Part-of-Speech tagging.
